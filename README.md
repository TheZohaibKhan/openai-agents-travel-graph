## Overview

OpenAI Agents Travel Graph is an advanced AI-powered travel planning system that leverages the latest in multi-agent technology to automate the entire travel planning process. The system orchestrates specialized agents to handle different aspects of travel planning, from destination research and flight bookings to accommodation selection and activity planning.

By combining the power of the OpenAI Agents SDK with graph-based orchestration through LangGraph, the system can maintain complex workflows while providing personalized travel recommendations that meet user preferences and budget constraints.

## System Architecture

The system follows a comprehensive multi-layered architecture with specialized agents coordinated through LangGraph:

```mermaid

    %% Main system layers
    UI[User Interface Layer] --> OL
    
    %% Orchestration layer
    subgraph OL[Orchestration Layer - LangGraph]
        SM[State Management]
        AWM[Agent Workflow Management]
        CP[Context Preservation]
    end
    
    %% Specialized agents
    OL --> DRA[Destination Research Agent]
    OL --> FSA[Flight Search Agent]
    OL --> ASA[Accommodation Search Agent] 
    OL --> TPA[Transportation Planning Agent]
    OL --> APA[Activity Planning Agent]
    
    %% Browser automation & budget management
    DRA & FSA & ASA & TPA & APA --> BAL[Browser Automation Layer]
    BAL --> BMA[Budget Management Agent]
    BMA --> KML[Knowledge & Memory Layer]
    KML --> PS[Persistent Storage - Supabase]
    
    %% Styling

    class UI,OL,BAL,KML,PS systemLayer
    class DRA,FSA,ASA,TPA,APA,BMA agent
```

Each specialized agent uses a combination of LLM capabilities and domain-specific tools to perform its tasks, with the orchestration layer maintaining state and ensuring proper handoffs between agents.

### Agent Interaction Flow

    end

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BjornMelin/openai-agents-travel-graph.git
cd openai-agents-travel-graph

# Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\\Scripts\\activate

# Install uv package manager
curl -sSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration

# Set up Supabase database
python supabase_setup.py init
```

### Supabase Setup

This project uses Supabase for data persistence. You need to set up a Supabase project and configure it with the database schema. The `supabase_setup.py` script automates this process:

```bash
# Initialize the database with required tables and indexes
python supabase_setup.py init

# Check the status of your Supabase database
python supabase_setup.py status

# Reset the database (WARNING: This will delete all data)
python supabase_setup.py reset

# Create test data for development
python supabase_setup.py init --test-data
```

For more information about the database schema, see [Migrations README](travel_planner/data/migrations/README.md).

## Usage

Run the travel planner in interactive mode:

```bash
python -m travel_planner.main
```

Or provide a query directly:

```bash
python -m travel_planner.main --query "I want to visit Tokyo for a week in October" --origin "New York" --budget "3000-5000"
```

For more options:

```bash
python -m travel_planner.main --help
```

## Development

If you'd like to contribute to the development of this project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for your changes
5. Run the test suite with `uv run pytest`
6. Submit a pull request

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as its Python package manager. For all Python-related commands, use `uv run` (e.g., `uv run pytest`, `uv run python script.py`).

### Package Management

This project now uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency management. The legacy `requirements.txt` files are kept only for backward compatibility.

To set up your development environment with uv:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment and install all dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run linting and type checking
uv run ruff .
uv run mypy .

# Format code
uv run black .
uv run isort .
```
